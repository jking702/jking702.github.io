Founded in 2023, the Imperial College Planetary Robotics Lab (IPRL) is a student run society focused on planetary robotics. Its flagship project is the development of a rover platform for the European Rover Challenge (ERC). While the rover has performed well from a mechanical standpoint, and is the only UK team to have qualified at the time of writing, it became clear that upgrades to the electrical infrastructure were necessary to support any future upgrades to the rover. For example, the use of more powerful motors for the drive, arm, or drill systems could improve mechanical performance, but would also require a more robust power solution capable of reliably delivering the higher currents demanded by such upgrades.

The following sections provide an overview of the requirements defined for this system, including certain conservative estimates and intentional overspecifications to ensure robustness, along with the design and testing efforts undertaken to produce a dedicated power distribution solution.
