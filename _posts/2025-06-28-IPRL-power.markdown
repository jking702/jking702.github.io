The IPRL power board honours this principle whilst learning from the lessons of its scorched ancestors, many of which bear the blackened and burnt traces that come from minimal overcurrent protection. Yet it remains faithful to the adage: 'If it ain't broke, it doesn't have enough features yet.' With more connectors than any system could ever need, itâ€™s designed so future rover models can build upon it with ease. And with copper traces rated to handle 50 amps before they even get mildly uncomfortable, it can provide more power than any future rover could require. This board is built not just to survive this year, but to power as many rovers as IPRL can churn out, delivering power without question and commanding authority without asking for it.
