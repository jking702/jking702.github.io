<!-- Motivation -->
With the exception of drag racers, every motor vehicle must negotiate corners. Ultimately, this boils down to a physics problem involving the g-forces experienced during braking, cornering, and accelerating out of turns. Measuring these accelerations throughout a race provides crucial insight for the driver. It leaves little room to question or second-guess what happened on the track once it's captured and understood through numbers.

Since most data loggers are proprietary, and their promotional material often states that only GPS is used to infer a kartâ€™s acceleration, it became necessary to build a custom accelerometer board. This provided a guarantee of accurate acceleration data could be collected to be intrepreted later, with a much higher frequency than the quoted rate from any data logger available.

# Requirements
An arbitary set of requirements was set based on the mounting position, data required and the communication method. The full requirements are kept here for clarity:
- 10 hour operation time
- Measurement of acceleration, both lateral and longitudinal to the kart
- Waterproof
- footprint less than 20mmx20mm
- Mounted discretely on an M4 bolt
