A usually overlooked part of electronics is containing the PCB or hardware after it has been made. This is a look into the iterative process of a batter/ power distribution box for a rover that competed in the European Rover Challenge (ERC) 2025.

# Specification

## Essential

- [ ]  Fit all the components, PCB main and secondary, battery and relay
- [ ]  Fit all cables to be routed within the enclosure (relay cables, battery)
- [ ]  Cutouts for XT60s and Estop button

## Desirable

- Easy removable battery
- Quick access to fuses for replacement
- Air holes for fans
- Gasket/ oring areas

# Prototyping
## V1
It's a fucking box, with all that would be needed. Carelessly made into one 3D print. But we can do better than this.

- I need to use a divot in the plastic to shield the cables, this thing does not need to be waterproof but it does need to not short in outdoor conditions
  - this means using something like either of these designs

- the only issues with that is that the length of the box would mean there is too much wasted space in this clam like box, also just not that great.
