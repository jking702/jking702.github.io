A usually overlooked part of electronics is what happens after the PCB has been designed and built: how it is contained and protected. In the previous post I covered the design of the power distribution PCB for our rover at the European Rover Challenge (ERC) 2025 with the Imperial Planetary Robotics Lab (IPRL) team. This post looks at the next step in the process, developing a battery and power distribution box to house both the PCB and the battery. Protection was essential not only against vibration but also against the dust of the simulated Mars yard and the possibility of rain during the competition.

# Requirements


# Design and Manufacturing Approach

# Final Enclosure

# Conclusion

Although it lacked the glamour of wheels or robotic arms, the enclosure was a critical part of making the rover competition-ready. It protected both the battery and the power distribution PCB from dust, vibration, and the possibility of rain, all within the projectâ€™s tight budget and resource constraints. With the hardware now secured inside a reliable container, the focus shifted to bringing the system to life through firmware, the next challenge, and the subject of the following post.
